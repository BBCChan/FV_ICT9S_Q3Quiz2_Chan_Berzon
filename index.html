					<td>In a world where the towns are peopled with cars, and even the bugs are mini motors, a young ambitious racing car called Lightning McQueen is a star. On his way to an important event he has to stop in the little town of Radiator Springs after he accidentally damages the road and is forced to repair it. He finds living in a community oddly endearing, making true friends and beginning to realise there's more in life than winning.</td>
					<td>In Cars 1, Owen Wilson played as Lightning McQueen(the main character of the movie), Sally Carrera was played by Bonnie Hunt and finally Mater was played by Larry the Cable Guy</td>
					<td>In my opinion, the first Cars movie really set the stage for the rest, it was seen to be as a great childrens movie and the movie to aspire childhood to people including me. The vast characters really made the move 10 times better and the plot was amazing. Including the lesson it implements and the morales of the main protagonist.</td>

					<td>Racecar Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) and his tow-truck buddy, Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), have had their share of adventures together but nothing like what they experience when they head overseas for the first-ever World Grand Prix. While Lightning has his eye on the road to the championship, Mater takes a detour to international espionage when he meets British master spy Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) and stunning spy-in-training Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer).</td>
					<td>In Cars 2 Lightning McQueen is still played by Owen Wilson, Mater still played Larry the Cable Guy.</td>
					<td>For Cars 2, it took a different step than the original movie. It gave us more of a diverse plot line with the new characters introduced to us. It was different and i liked it. The different places it took us in the movies made it even better.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Blindsided by a new generation of blazing-fast cars, the legendary Lighting McQueen finds himself pushed out of the sport that he loves. Hoping to get back in the game, he turns to Cruz Ramirez, an eager young technician who has her own plans for winning. With inspiration from the Fabulous Hudson Hornet and a few unexpected turns, No. 95 prepares to compete on Piston Cup Racing's biggest stage.</td>
					<td>In Cars 3, Lightning McQueen is played by Owen Wilson and Mater by Larry the Cable guy. The addition of Cruz Ramirez to the main cast who was played by Cristela Alonzo</td>
					<td>In Cars 3, it sorta went back to the original plot line with the racing, but it introduced us to a plot twist we weren't ready for which was McQueen stepping down and brining up the new car for it to take the task of McQueen. Overall it was a great movie to end off the trilogy.</td>
